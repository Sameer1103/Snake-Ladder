        <h2>Instructions :-</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>It is a game for two players. Player 1 gets to make the opening move in this exciting game.</li>
            <li>Each player gets one token to play.</li>
            <li>At any point of time, reload the page to restart the game.</li>
            <li>The players move their tokens from left to right, starting at 1. After following the numbers on the board, the player goes to the next row from right to left and then goes to the next row from left to right, and repeats.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on the snake's head, their token will slide down to the bottom of the snake's tail, landing on the box where the tail ends. Their token will remain in the same spot until their next turn.</li>
            <li>If a player lands at the ladder's base, their token immediately climbs to the top of the ladder, landing on the box where the ladder ends. Their token will remain in the same spot until their next turn.</li>
            <li>If a player rolls a 6, they get an extra turn. The player can keep rolling sixes and move ahead in the game. However, if they land at the bottom of the ladder or on the snake's head, they need to move their token down or up and then roll again to take their extra turn.</li>
            <li>The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get to the last space. If the roll is too high, the player's piece will bounce off the last space and move back. For example, if a player had four spaces to get to 100 and rolled a 6, the piece will move four spaces to 100, then â€œbounce back" two spaces to 98.</li><br>
